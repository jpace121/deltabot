#Delta Bot#

This repository is an Open Source Lab Notebook for my deltabot project.    
    
Most of the pages will be Markdown, and should be buildable with pandoc.
As the site grows and I figure out how to use it, I'll figure out some sort of
a decent plan.   

For right now, enjoy a link dump of various facts.
