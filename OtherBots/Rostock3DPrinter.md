##Information##
RepRap Delta Bot design.  Has the cool belt system instead of the arms, 
which could be easier to implement.     

The wiki page includes links to other similar deltas.  The nice part is they
all have BOMs that we can steal from.

##Kossel##

The reprap guys have moved onto the Kossell described 
[here](http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel).

I like it for the most part, but I have mixed feelings on the linear movement
stuff. I think it looks cooler to go the direction Func did, with the levers,
but that's pure speculation.
